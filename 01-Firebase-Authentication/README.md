## Firebase Authentication:

Most apps need to know the identity of a user. Knowing a user's identity allows an app to securely save user data in the cloud and provide 
the same personalized experience across all of the user's devices.

Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. 
It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.
